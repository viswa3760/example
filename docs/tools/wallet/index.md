**2**. So new users click on "Get Started," and in the next step you will have to create a password, which should be a strong one. for example, if I try to use a simple one like "one, two, three, four" and click on "continue," it won't allow  and shows an error.

!!! tip
    This password is not saved on any server. Dojima Network will never save your passwords; this password will be on your local device, the one that you are using. The password is used to encrypt the seed phrase, which will be seen in the next step.


**4**. In this step, you will receive your seed phrase, which is a collection of words, typically 12 or 24, that users can choose based on their interests for improved security. A 24-word seed phrase is suggested.

!!! tip
    You don't have to sit and write every word, simply click on copy seed, it's that simple.


!!! warning
    Before you proceed, save it somewhere, preferably a text file, because next time you log in, you will need to upload the seed phrase.


!!! danger
    Never reveal your seed phrase.


**5**. So in this step, we have to verify the seed phrase, so select the words in order from the seed phrase you copied earlier.
