**2**. In this step, you can drag and drop your seed phrase or upload a text file.

!!! tip
    If you have registered with Dojima Wallet or if you have a seed phrase from any other wallet, you can use that seed phrase to link with Dojima Wallet.


!!! tip
    If you have multiple wallet accounts from different chains, don't worry; you can connect all of them in the Dojima wallet later. For now, just use any one of the seed phrases.


!!! tip
    You can enter your seed phrase manually also, but it is suggested that you upload a text file to save time.

**3**. In this step, you have to create a password to encrypt the seed phrase that you just uploaded.

!!! tip
    Dojima wallet will never save your passwords it will reset every time you log out. So new password every
    time you log in making it more secure.


!!! tip
    The password must be at least eight characters long and contain one lowercase, one uppercase, one number, and one special case character, so I'll use something like this now and click continue.


**4**. That's it. You are in your Dojima wallet now, and you can explore the dashboard.
