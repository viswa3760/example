title: Hermes Chain
---

### Hermes Layer
The Hermes layer is a vital component within the Dojima Network's multi-layer architecture, playing a crucial role in ensuring seamless cross-chain interoperability and efficient liquidity management.
Its primary responsibilities include managing native token liquidity from all blockchains, overseeing staking and rewards management for liquidity providers. 
It ensures the proper functioning of validators, enforces slashing mechanisms for network security, collects transaction fees, and, most importantly, offers developers universal access to cross-chain liquidity. 
This layer plays a pivotal role in enabling seamless interoperability and efficient liquidity management across the Dojima Network.

Main modules inside Hermes Chain are:
 - Narada
 - Threshold signature scheme
 - Fortunas
 - Sors

### Narada
Narada functions as a central hub connecting clients to the Hermes chain. Its primary responsibility is to monitor blockchain 
events i.e. swapping of Arweave -> Ethereum, Arweave -> Dojima and other custom messages. It also transforms these events into Hermes layer-compatible messages and relays them to the hermes layer.

<!-- 
- Chain clients
- Observer
- Signer -->


* **Chain clients** 

	Chain clients are responsible for reading events from their respective blockchains. Client will listen to hermes wallet address transactions as destination/target address. 
     Currently supported chain clients are Arweave, Bitcoin, Binance, Cosmos, Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot.

* **Observer**

     Observer is responsible for transforming and transmitting observed events to the hermes layer.

* **Signer**

     Signer is responsible for signing transactions onto the destination chain that received from the Hermes chain.

### Threshold signature scheme ( TSS )

Threshold signature scheme is responsible for securing the liquidity which is being held in the Hermes chain. Liquidity is holded by fortunas vaults. Dojima has written many articles on tss, please checkout https://medium.com/@dojimanetwork for more on tss. Each chain supports certains signature mechanism for signing wallet transactions like `secp256k1` curve of `ECDSA` algorithm for `Ethereum`, `Binance`, `Cosmos`, `Binance` and `RSA` for `Arweave` and `ed25519` for `Solana`, `Polkadot`. Currently, dojima has support for `ecdsa`, `rsa`, `ed25519` signature algorithms.

### Fortunas

Fortunas are responsible for holding liquidity of multiple tokens at single place which are generated by dojima tss. Security of liquidity depends on the number of validators managed by tss. When swapping of tokens are involved ( Binance -> Arweave), â…” of validators will sign to release the desired token amount on the destination chain requested for swap received from the hermes chain. Since tss is a slow process, for small swap amounts is a drawback. To overcome this, Sors is introduced.

### Sors

Sors are responsible for sending small amounts of requested swap tokens onto the destination chain. Each validator can be a sors. Validator will be assigned 25% of total amount supported tokens based on validator staked amount.
