title: System Requirements
---

The system requirements listed in this section are both for the [Hermes](/architecture/introduction.md) node and the [Dojima](/developers/quickstart.md) node.

The **minimum** system requirements mean you can run the nodes but the setup is not future-proof.

The **recommended** system requirements mean the nodes are future-proof. There is, however, no upper limit to future-proofing your nodes.

You must always run the hermes node and the dojima node on separate machines.
