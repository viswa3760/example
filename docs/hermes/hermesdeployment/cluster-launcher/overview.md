## Cluster Launcher

Deploying a HERMESNode with Kubernetes

### Deploy a Kubernetes cluster

In order to deploy all the different services and provide a high availability environment to operate your node, Kubernetes is the preferred scheduling platform. Any production-grade Kubernetes cluster can be used to run and deploy a HERMESNode. You need your Kubernetes provider to offer external load balancers services type features. Azure, Digital Ocean, GCE, OpenStack are compatible with external load balancers.

!!! info
    Terraform is a type of domain-specific language (DSL) used to describe code infrastructure. It is designed to make it easier to create/destroy infrastructure hosted locally or by a provider.


This Terraform deployment will deploy a Kubernetes cluster using your VPS provider credentials and EKS service. The cluster will have autoscaling capabilities, which means you don’t have to deal with how many nodes you need to deploy to run your HERMESNode services.

All the default configurations used in these instructions are for a production environment with enough resources to run your HERMESNode in good conditions

!!! warning

    LINUX/MAC is the preferred method of setup.

    Windows should choose either:

    1. Deploy a HERMESNode from a Linux VPS.
    2. Use Windows Subsystem for Linux - [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)


### Steps

There are three important steps to getting your node set up, deployed and churned in.

1. [Setting up Cluster](../cluster-launcher/setup-aws.md)
2. [Deploying HERMESNode Services](../deploying.md)

#### Repository Management

Your repository should be organised as follows:
```
./hermesnode-ops
  |./cluster-launcher
  |./node-launcher
```
All of your set up commands are run in `cluster-launcher` and all of your deploying/joining/managing/leaving commands are run from `node-launcher`

#### Running Two or More Nodes

!!! danger
    To prevent a catastrophic mistake in handling multiple nodes, set them up on different machines, or use different user profiles on your machine, or in the least, use different repos:


```
./hermesnode-ops
  |./cluster-launcher
  |./node-launcher
./hermesnode-ops2
  |./cluster-launcher
  |./node-launcher
```

All of your commands can now be run separately.

!!! info
    It is heavily advised to not set up nodes on the same provider. Deploy 1 node on Azure, 1 node on Digital Ocean etc.
