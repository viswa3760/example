## Cluster Launcher

Deploying a HERMESNode with Kubernetes

### Deploy a Kubernetes cluster

In order to deploy all the different services and provide a high availability environment to operate your node, Kubernetes is the preferred scheduling platform. Any production-grade Kubernetes cluster can be used to run and deploy a HERMESNode. You need your Kubernetes provider to offer external load balancers services type features. Azure, Digital Ocean, GCE, OpenStack are compatible with external load balancers.

!!! info
    Terraform is a type of domain-specific language (DSL) used to describe code infrastructure. It is designed to make it easier to create/destroy infrastructure hosted locally or by a provider.


This Terraform deployment will deploy a Kubernetes cluster using your VPS provider credentials and EKS service. The cluster will have autoscaling capabilities, which means you donâ€™t have to deal with how many nodes you need to deploy to run your HERMESNode services.

All the default configurations used in these instructions are for a production environment with enough resources to run your HERMESNode in good conditions

!!! warning

    LINUX/MAC is the preferred method of setup.

    Windows should choose either:

    1. Deploy a HERMESNode from a Linux VPS.
    2. Use Windows Subsystem for Linux - [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)


### Steps

There are three important steps to getting your node set up, deployed and churned in.

1. [Setting up Cluster](../cluster-launcher/setup-aws.md)
2. [Deploying HERMESNode Services](../deploying.md)

#### Repository Management

Your repository should be organised as follows:
```
./hermesnode-ops
  |./cluster-launcher
  |./node-launcher
```
All of your set up commands are run in `cluster-launcher` and all of your deploying/joining/managing/leaving commands are run from `node-launcher`

#### Running Two or More Nodes

!!! danger
    To prevent a catastrophic mistake in handling multiple nodes, set them up on different machines, or use different user profiles on your machine, or in the least, use different repos:


```
./hermesnode-ops
  |./cluster-launcher
  |./node-launcher
./hermesnode-ops2
  |./cluster-launcher
  |./node-launcher
```

All of your commands can now be run separately.

!!! info
    It is heavily advised to not set up nodes on the same provider. Deploy 1 node on Azure, 1 node on Digital Ocean etc.
