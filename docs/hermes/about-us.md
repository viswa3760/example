# About Us

![medium](../img/hermes/dojimainvester.jpg)

The term Dojima has its origin in Japan. Dojima was derived from the name of the worldâ€™s first derivative exchange in Japan in the 16th century and was adopted for the Dojima Network.

The Dojima Network was founded by Bhagath Reddy and Akhil Reddy in 2020 following the inherent problems associated with the new web 3 space. While working on a major Ethereum protocol between 2019 and 2020, Bhagath and Akhil were faced with daunting problems with regard to high gas fees and the limitation of only accessing tokens from the Ethereum blockchain. Based on this problem, they observed that all developers on every independent blockchain are limited by the ecosystem of that particular blockchain, thereby leading to non-provision for developers to access the best of all the blockchain platforms, hence the idea and birth of the Dojima Network.

Since its inception, the Dojima Network team has been working round the clock to build a robust cross-chain platform to bring in liquidity, Dapps, and users to a common middle ground, thereby eliminating the need to use multiple wallets and blockchains. This has been possible by organizing a team that is capable of building a decentralized product for the crypto space.

The Dojima Network founders have built the initial team and designed the architecture and also managed to bring together the initial components required for MVP and demoed it on Arweave Open Web Foundry and subsequently formed a few partnerships. Ever since the team has grown five times from what it used to be in the span of 6 months. But we have not stopped there. The team is continuously acquiring good and suitable talents as per requirement.

In 2021, we got incubated by the Arweave Open Web Foundry and we became the finalist. Shortly after that (precisely Q4 2021), we completed our seed round and got funding from the top VCs in the crypto space.

Based on requirements and value proposition alongside capital, the Dojima team would consider investors from the non-crypto space. But at the moment we are happy with the investors that are already on board to push this project to fruition.

Fast forward to the third quarter of 2022 we are gearing up to launch our testnet in Q3 of 2022. The launch of the testnet will also follow with the release of cross-chain platforms along with a cross-chain wallet and cross-chain applications for testing purposes. During this period, proper documentation would be implemented for deploying and establishing a cross-chain connection on the Dojima network. So, between the period of the testnet and mainnet, a suite of tools will be released for easy onboarding and deployment of Dapps onto the Dojima Network.

Also worthy of note is that during this period, our revamped website would be launched in preparation for the testnet and subsequently the mainnet launch in the first half of 2023. The new website will go live in Q3 2022. Do not hesitate to check our new website on [https://www.dojima.network](https://www.dojima.network) and familiarize yourself with it.

The aim of dojima network has been stated, the project is in the pipeline, the road map has been set, the team is working and growing, and something unique is coming. Dojima Network will surely be a catalyst in the blockchain and crypto cross-chain infrastructure space.
