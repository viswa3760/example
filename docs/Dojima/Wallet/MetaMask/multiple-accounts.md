You can create more accounts this way. When you create multiple accounts, your addresses will be different at your end.

## Import Account 

* Open your wallet browser extension from your browser
* Select **Settings > Import Account**
* Copy the **Private key**(You can find this in the Account Details) from your local account, paste it into the window provided, and select Import
