!!! warning
    NON-NATIVE WALLET SUPPORT
    
    Wallets denoted with * in the table above are not natively supported with the wallet software and require manual steps to add the Dojima network.


## Key Management Strategy

The following basic steps allow for the integration of a client-side application with Dojima:

1. **Set up Web3**: [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/) is a javascript library that allows a client-side application to talk to the blockchain. We configure web3 to communicate via a developer-based wallet like MetaMask. Use the [web3.js docs ](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.2/getting-started.html#adding-web3-js) to learn about adding `web3.js` to your project.
2. **Set up an Account**: You will be able to send transactions (specifically ones that alter the state of the blockchain).
3. **Instantiate Contracts**: Once a web3 object in place, we next instantiate our deployed contract, with which we interact.
4. **Call functions**: Fetch data via functions in the contract - through our contract object.
