    UPDATING THE DEVELOP DOCS

    The docs are being updated, enhanced, and improved. They are subject to change. Please feel free to raise an issue or pull request if you have any queries or suggestions.


Welcome to **Dojima** The most innovative and exciting platform to develop your blockchain application. Blockchain technology is poised to revolutionize how the digital world manages data and conducts business. You can join this revolution by getting a head start on Dojima's decentralized application (dApp) development.

This guide will introduce you to the Dojima ecosystem. You'll find links to valuable resources and websites that will bring you up to speed on building, not only on Dojima but also on general blockchain application development.

## Building on Dojima

If you are an Ethereum developer, you are already a Dojima developer. Simply switch to the [Dojima RPC](https://api-test.d11k.dojima.network:8545/) and get started. All the tools you are familiar with on the Ethereum blockchain are supported on Dojima by default, such as Truffle, Remix, and Web3js.

You can deploy decentralized applications to either Dojima Testnet or the Mainnet. The Dojima Testnet connects with the Ethereum Goërli Testnet, which acts as its ParentChain. You can find all the network-related details in the **[network documentation]**.

### Wallets

To interact with the Dojima Network, you need to have an Ethereum-based wallet because Dojima runs on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). You can choose to set up a Metamask or Arkane Wallet. More on wallet-related information and why you need one can be found in our wallet documentation.

### Smart Contracts

Dojima supports many services you can use to test, compile, debug, and deploy decentralized applications onto the Dojima Network. These include deployment using Alchemy, Chainstack, QuickNode, Remix, Truffle, Hardhat, and Replit.

<!-- ### Connecting to Dojima

You can add Dojima to Metamask or directly use Arkane, which allows you to connect to Dojima using RPC.

In order to connect with the Dojima Network to read blockchain information, we recommend using the Alchemy SDK.

```js
// Javascript
// Setup: npm install alchemy-sdk
const { Alchemy, Network } = require("alchemy-sdk");

const settings = {
  apiKey: "demo", // Can replace with your API Key from https://www.alchemy.com
  Network: Network.DOJIMA_TESTNET, 
};

const alchemy = new Alchemy(settings);

async function main() {
  const latestBlock = await alchemy.core.getBlockNumber();
  console.log("The latest block number is", latestBlock);
}

main();
``` -->

### Building a new dApp on Dojima?

Decentralized applications (dApps) act as the bridge between users and their data privacy on the blockchain. The increasing number of dApps validates their usefulness within the blockchain ecosystem, solving challenges like executing transactions between two participants without the need for central authority via smart contracts.

Suppose you have no prior experience building decentralized applications (dApps). In that case, the below-mentioned resources will give you a head start on the tools required to build, debug, and deploy dApps on the Dojima Network.

### Already have a dApp?

If you already have a decentralized application (dApp) and are looking for a platform to help you scale efficiently, then you are at the right place because Dojima allows you to:

1. **Easily migrate from Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based chain**: Dojima prides itself in being the ultimate Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum. You don't have to worry about the underlying architecture while moving or deploying your dApps to the Dojima Network as long as it is EVM-compatible

2. **Use Dojima as a faster transaction layer**: Deploying your dApp to the Dojima Mainnet allows you to leverage Dojima as a faster transaction layer for your dApp. Additionally, you can get your tokens mapped by us. You can join our technical discussions group on Telegram to learn more.

## Side Note

 If this is overwhelming, that’s alright! You can jump right into the action and start hacking. Here are some notes before you start diving into resources, repositories, and docs:

1. **Beware the cost of being on the bleeding edge**: Like typical niche programming, dApps and blockchain development moves very quickly. While researching, you may find complex code repositories, 404s on a documentation site, or even no documentation. Use that opportunity to reach out to us via any social media channel.

2. **The learning curve may be daunting, but the barrier to entry is low**: The community is very open and welcoming! Projects welcome pull requests from outsiders and resolve any blockers actively. We’re working on creating a better world and contribution in any form is appreciated. We’ll be grateful to onboard you into this amazing Web3 ecosystem.
